# satellite

Position a container around the edge of another. The screenshot below shows all its positioning options. I have added basic styling in the screenshot to make the satellites visible. However out of the box it comes with no styling opinions. This project is based off component/tip which I found to be widely useful outside of tooltips. This is an extraction of the core functionality from that project, enhanced to suit my more general use cases.
